                                        results. The count is only incremented 
                                        for launches that match the kernel 
                                        filters.
  -s [ --launch-skip ] arg (=0)         Set the number of kernel launches to 
                                        skip before starting to profile. The 
                                        count is incremented for launches that 
                                        match the kernel filters only.
  --launch-skip-before-match arg (=0)   Set the number of kernel launches to 
                                        skip before starting to profile. The 
                                        count is incremented for all launches.
  --list-sections                       List all sections found in the search 
                                        paths.
  --section arg                         Identifier of section to collect. Regex
                                        allows matching full section 
                                        identifier. If not specified, all

                                        profile results. If not set, a 
                                        temporary file will be used which is 
                                        removed afterwards.
  -f [ --force-overwrite ]              Force overwriting all output files (any

                                        output. Implies --units base by 
                                        default.
  --page arg                            Select report page to output:

                                          base
                                          (Show metrics with their base unit)
  --fp                                  Show all numeric metrics as floating 
                                        point numbers.
  --summary arg (=none)                 Set the summary output mode:

Use the --mode switch to select how to use the tool:
  Launch and profile a Cuda application:
      nv-nsight-cu-cli CuVectorAdd

  Launch an application for later attach:
      nv-nsight-cu-cli --mode=launch MyApp
  Attach to a previously launched application:
      nv-nsight-cu-cli --mode=attach --hostname 127.0.0.1
  Applications can also be launched or attached-to with the graphical user interface.

Select specific launches for profiling:
  Profile first two launches of kernel 'foo':
      nv-nsight-cu-cli -k foo -c 2 CuVectorAdd

Load an existing report:
      nv-nsight-cu-cli --import myReport

Usage of --nvtx-include and --nvtx-exclude:
  nv-nsight-cu-cli --nvtx --nvtx-include "Domain A@Range A"
     Profile kernels wrapped inside start/end range 'Range A' of 'Domain A'
  nv-nsight-cu-cli --nvtx --nvtx-exclude "Range A]"
    Profile all kernels except kernels wrapped inside push/pop range 'Range A' of <default domain> at the top of the stack.
  nv-nsight-cu-cli --nvtx --nvtx-include "Range A" --nvtx-exclude "Range B"
     Profile kernels wrapped inside start/end range 'Range A' but not inside  'Range B' of <default domain>
